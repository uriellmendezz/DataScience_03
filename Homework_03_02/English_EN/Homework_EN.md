In order to ensure that the quality of the information with which you are going to work is optimal, it is necessary to make a list of improvement proposals taking into account the following points:

1) How up to date is the information? Can the way in which this information is updated or maintained be improved?
2) Is the data complete in all tables?
3) Are the sources of the data known?
4) It is important to check the consistency of the data. Can all the tables be related to the model?
5) What are fact tables and dimensional or master tables?
6) Can we do this separation in the data we have (dimension and fact tables)?
7) Are there duplicate keys?
8) Which are qualitative variables and which are quantitative?
9) What actions can we apply on them?
